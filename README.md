A library of classes and methods for Dart. Flexible and easy-to-use options to simplify and keep your code clean.
The project was born out of the need to repeat code in various projects. Initially, it was a class with some methods that always needed to be modified in each project. Today, InnerLibs has more than 120 extension methods for various common operations.
 


## Features

- Tons of `String`, `num` , `bool` and `date` manipulation methods
- Classes `Brasil`, `Cidade`, `Estado`, `Endereco`, and `InfoUsuario` for Brazilian developers to integrate information about cities and states into their applications.
- Enum `NamedColors` with almost all color names in the world.
- Export methods from many external libraries like `darq`, `GetX`, `collection` and more


and many other functions, see the complete documentation [here](https://zonaro.github.io/innerlibs_dart)
